Thursday, October 17, 2024

The PhD Forum consists of a poster session, preceded by a fast-paced introduction by each student that offers a preview of the posters. Each student is given a strictly-timed 2-minutes’ slot to present a “pitch talk” about her/his research. The purpose of the pitch talk is to provide a brief outline of one’s doctoral research work, with the goal to raise awareness and generate further discussion over the poster session and coffee break that follow.
